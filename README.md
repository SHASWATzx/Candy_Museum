Website created using bootstrap 


****IMP NOTE I HAVE USED BOOTSTRAP v5.1
    So, if theres a new version pls change the CSS and JS link from Bootstrap

Well, this was a code-along challenge in my web development course which I have been doing for quite a while and recently the course introduced me to bootstrap and it was pretty simple to understand.
I used to thought it is some complicated framework and thanks to the course my fear was gone and I had fun building this project.

Well, the website I build looks 40% different from the original and that's how I roll with these follow-along challenges to fully grasp the concept so that in the future I would be able to do a thing on my own.
